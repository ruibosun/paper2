## Abstract 

This abstract presents the results of an investigation into the effect of subway system openings on urban air pollution, with a focus on particulate concentrations. The study found that, in cities with higher initial pollution levels, the opening of a subway system was associated with a 4% reduction in particulates in the vicinity of the city center, which persisted over a four-year time horizon. This reduction was estimated to result in an external mortality benefit of approximately \$1 billion per year in highly polluted cities. The results suggest that the cost of reduced mortality due to lower air pollution may offset a significant portion of the construction costs of subways. The findings of this study can be replicated in other cities to further understand the relationship between subway openings and air pollution.

## Introduction

The paper investigates the impact of subway systems on air pollution in cities around the world. It uses two main data sources: a description of the world's subway systems and a measure of airborne particulates, Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), recorded by satellites between February 2000 and December 2017. The analysis uses a comparison of changes in AOD within a city before and after the opening of a subway system to establish its causal effect.

The results show that the average effect of subway openings on AOD is a small decrease that cannot be distinguished from zero, but there is significant heterogeneity across cities. In the case of the 26 cities where AOD fell after the subway opened, the decrease was largest in cities whose initial level of AOD was above the median. The decrease in AOD levels was found to persist for at least 4 years. The results also indicate that subway ridership is a key factor in reducing AOD levels and that subway expansions beyond the initial line have small effects on AOD levels.

The study provides important information for policymakers considering the implementation of subway systems to mitigate air pollution. Based on the results, the authors estimate that a subway opening in an average city initially in the top half of the AOD distribution prevents 22.5 infant deaths and 500 total deaths per year, which is worth about \$43m and \$1b per year, respectively. The results suggest that subway systems may be cost-effective in reducing air pollution, particularly in cities with high initial levels of AOD. The study also sheds light on transportation behavior in developing countries, finding no evidence of differences between developing and developed world cities in their response to subways.

The study aims to investigate the effect of subways on urban air pollution by using data from a panel of cities. The subways data, used from Gonzalez-Navarro and Turner (2018) and updated to December 2017, define a subway as an electric-powered urban rail system isolated from interactions with vehicle and pedestrian traffic. The latitude, longitude, and date of opening of every subway station in the world were compiled manually between 2012 and 2014. The air pollution data used are based on remotely sensed measures of suspended particulates from Terra and Aqua satellites, providing daily measures of aerosol optical depth of the atmosphere at a 3 km spatial resolution from 2000 to 2017. The study considers the change in aerosol optical depth (AOD) in the period extending from 18 months before to 18 months after a subway opening, using a sample of 58 subway system openings between 2001 and 2016. The study also has ridership data for 42 of the 58 cities, with an average daily ridership of 130,000 people in the 18th month of operation. The study finds that ridership triples over the first three years of operation and begins to slow after three years. The average time construction began was 77 months prior to the opening.

The results of a study on the Aerial Optical Depth (AOD) within 10 km of city centers using satellite imagery from Terra and Aqua satellites. The study aimed to evaluate the relationship between the remotely-sensed AOD and ground-measured particulate matter (pm10 and pm2.5). The results show that AOD is a highly predictive measure of ground-measured particulate matter and the relationship is not sensitive to the exact region used to calculate city average AOD. The study used a monthly average of AOD readings within 10 km of the city center, calculated by averaging over all pixel-days of AOD readings that fall in this region during the month and weighting by the number of pixels observed each day. The results showed that in 2017, the average AOD reading within 10 km of a city center from the Aqua satellite was 0.40 and higher in Asian cities, whereas it was lower in European and North American cities. The second panel of Table 1 presents the AOD averages for 2000 using only the Terra satellite.
